**Note: This is a work in progress.**

podCloud feeds aim to provides a fast and easy access to feeds created (or relayed) on podCloud.

## How to use

In order for the MongoDB part of this example to work, you need to have MongoDB installed on your machine. All other required parts come with this package.

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

The server should now accept requests at http://localhost:8880/graphql and provides a UI tool at http://localhost:8880/graphiql
